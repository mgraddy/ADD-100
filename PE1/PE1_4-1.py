'''Objective: Write a Python program that includes two functions - one to calculate the area of a square and another for the area of a circle.
Instructions:
Start with Function Definitions: Define two functions: square and circle.
Each function should take one parameter (side for square, radius for circle).
Write the square Function: Calculate the area as side * side and display the result: "The area of the square is [result] square units."
Write the circle Function: Calculate the area using the formula: area = π * radius * radius. Use 3.14 for π.
Display the result: "The area of the circle is [result] square units."
Test Your Functions: Call square and circle with sample values.'''
def square(side):
    area = side * side
    print(f"The area of the square is {area} square units")
def circle(radius):
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    print(f"The area of the square is {area} square units")
